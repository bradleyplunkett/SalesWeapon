A Google Chrome Extension initially designed for my friend Colten and his fellow tech sales professionals. The extension's goal is to allows sales reps to easily identify which past employers on prospects' linkedin profiles are existing customers. This way, they can mention that info in their outreach emails to enhance personalization, relevance, and # of booked meetings.  DOM manipulation has proven quite difficult (perhaps Linkedin doesn't want people scraping data from their site...) so this is still a work in progress.  Currently, the extension overrides the default background and adds a GIF from the Wolf of Wall Street.
